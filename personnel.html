            <h2>John Wheatley - Baritone Saxophone</h2>
            <div class="paragraph">
                John started playing saxophone in a grade school band program and studied saxophone performance for
                three months at the
                University of Cincinnati College Conservatory of Music. Family circumstances required retirement from
                music. He didn't
                play for thirty years while establishing a career in finance and raising a family. He gradually began
                playing again and upon
                retirement chased his passion for playing music with various groups in Alaska, Western Washington, and
                Florida including Sarasota
                Jazz Project, Jazz Ambassadors, SRQuintet and Swingtide Quintet.
